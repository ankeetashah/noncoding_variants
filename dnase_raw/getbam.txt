Because the bam files are large, I am just including their accession numbers here and what they are linked as:

ENCFF000SKV.bam --> GM12878_1.bam
ENCFF000SKW.bam --> GM12878_2.bam
ENCFF000SKZ.bam --> GM12878_3.bam
ENCFF000SLB.bam --> GM12878_4.bam
ENCFF000SLD.bam --> GM12878_5.bam

the cleanbam.sh script was then run
after, the bam files were convered to the bed files seen in this directory
